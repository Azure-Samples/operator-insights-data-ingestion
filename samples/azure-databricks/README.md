# Ingestion using Azure Databricks

TODO

_This contains extra setup/usage information relevant to the Azure Databricks sample.
This is necessary because the Databricks sample is more complicated than the other samples, and won't
run correctly straight out of the box. For example, you need to set up an additional key vault with the Key Vault Access Policy permissions model._

Any other samples with similar complexity will also have their own subfolders and READMEs.
