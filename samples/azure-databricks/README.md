# Ingestion using Azure Databricks

This contains extra setup/usage information relevant to the Azure Databricks sample.
This is necessary because the Databricks sample is more complicated than the other samples, and won't
run correctly straight out of the box.

Any other samples with similar complexity will also have their own subfolders and READMEs.
